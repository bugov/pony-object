=head1 NAME

Pony::Object the object system.

=head1 OVERVIEW

Pony::Object is an object system, which provides simple way to use cute objects.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Pony::Object;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When some package using Pony::Object, it's becoming strict (and shows warnings)
and modern (can use perl 5.10 features like as C<say>). Also C<dump> function
is using now as Data::Dumper. It's useful on debugging.

=head2 Specific moments

Besides new function C<dump> Pony::Object has other specific moments.

=head3 has

Keyword C<has> says Pony::Object about new object fields.
All fields are public. You can also describe object methods via C<has>...
If you want.

    package News;
    use Pony::Object;
    
        # Fields
        has 'title';
        has text => '';
        has authors => [ qw/Alice Bob/ ];
        
        # Methods
        has printTitle => sub
            {
                my $this = shift;
                say $this->title;
            }

        sub printAuthors
            {
                my $this = shift;
                print @{ $this->authors };
            }
    1;

    package main;
    use News;
    
    my $news = new News;
    $news->printAuthors();
    $news->title = 'Something important';
    $news->printTitle();

Pony::Object fields are changing via "=". For example: $obj->field = 'a'.

=head3 new

Pony::Object hasn't method C<new>. In fact, of course it has. But C<new> is an
internal function, so you should not use it if you want not have additional fun.
Instead of this Pony::Object has C<init> function, where you can write the same,
what you wanna write in C<new>. C<init> is after-hook for C<new>.

    package News;
    use Pony::Object;
    
        has title => undef;
        has lower => undef;
        
        sub init
            {
                my $this = shift;
                $this->title = shift;
                $this->lower = lc $this->title;
            }
    1;

    package main;
    use News;
    
    my $news = new News('Big Event!');
    
    print $news->lower;

=head3 ALL

If you wanna get all default values of Pony::Object-based class
(fields, of course), you can call C<ALL> method. I don't know why you need them,
but you can do it.

    package News;
    use Pony::Object;
    
        has 'title';
        has text => '';
        has authors => [ qw/Alice Bob/ ];
        
    1;

    package main;
    use News;
    
    my $news = new News;
    
    print for keys %{ $news->ALL() };

=head3 Inheritance

To define base classes you should set them as params on Pony::Object use.
For example, use Pony::Object 'Base::Class';

    package FirstPonyClass;
    use Pony::Object;
    
        # properties
        has a => 'a';
        has d => 'd';
        
        # method
        has b => sub
            {
                my $this = shift;
                   $this->a = 'b';
                   
                return ( @_ ?
                            shift:
                            'b'  );
            };
        
        # traditional perl method
        sub c { 'c' }
    
    1;

    package SecondPonyClass;
    # extends FirstPonyClass
    use Pony::Object qw/FirstPonyClass/;
    
        # Redefine property.
        has d => 'dd';
        
        # Redefine method.
        has b => sub
            {
                my $this = shift;
                   $this->a = 'bb';
                   
                return ( @_ ?
                            shift:
                            'bb'  );
            };
        
        # New method.
        has e => sub {'e'};
    
    1;

=head3 Singletons

For singletons Pony::Object has simplpe definition. You just should declare that
on use Pony::Object;

    package Notes;
    use Pony::Object 'singleton';
    
        has list => [];
        
        sub add
            {
                my $this = shift;
                push @{ $this->list }, @_;
            }
        
        sub flush
            {
                my $this = shift;
                $this->list = [];
            }
    
    1;

    package main;
    use Notes;
    
    my $n1 = new Notes;
    my $n2 = new Notes;
    
    $n1->add( qw/eat sleep/ );
    $n1->add( 'Meet with Mary at 8 o`clock' );
    
    $n2->flush;
    
    # Em... When I must meet Mary?
